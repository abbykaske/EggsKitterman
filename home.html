    <h2>Hi, I'm Eggs Kitterman!</h2>
    <img src="drone.png"width="500"height=auto>
    <p>I'm just a cat, enjoying the good life. I didn't always have such a good life, which you can learn more about in the <a href="aboutme.html">About Me Section.</a> Most of my days are spent chillin' out max and relaxin' all cool, occasionally shootin some hoops outside of the school. Mostly, I just can help but makin' trouble in the neighborhood. As you can see above, I'm also an excelent drone hunter.</p>
